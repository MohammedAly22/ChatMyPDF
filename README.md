# ChatMyPDF - Chat with Your PDFs using RAG

## üöÄ Overview

ChatMyPDF is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application** that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them using an AI-powered chatbot. It uses **embedding-based retrieval** to extract relevant information from PDFs and **LLM-powered generation** to provide context-aware responses.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline**, consisting of the following steps:

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload a PDF file.
2. **Text Extraction & Chunking**: The text is extracted and split into meaningful chunks.
3. **Embeddings Generation**: Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings using `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`.
4. **Indexing**: The embeddings are stored in a vector database for fast retrieval.
5. **Query Optimization**: User queries are optimized for better retrieval.
6. **Retrieval & Contextual Response**: The system retrieves the most relevant text chunks and generates a response using an LLM (Cohere/Gemini).

### Basic RAG Architecture
Here is the most basic RAG architecture:
![basic_rag_animation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36f89f7e-ee63-4db5-8e5f-32b2fcd82467)

### ChatMyPDF - Version 1.0.0
This version contains the basic RAG implementation leveraging:
- `InMemoryVectorStore` for easily store the embeddings.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for chunking.
![version_1 0 0_animation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add556e1-a756-4df5-8d35-a53750e15ed5)

### ChatMyPDF - Version 1.1.0
This version contains a little bit of advanced RAG implementation compared to `v1.0.0` including:
- Using `ChromaDB` vector database instead of `InMemoryVectorStore`.
- Using `PyMuPDFLoader` for data loading instead of `PyPDFLoader`.
- Using `SemanticChuncker` for a more advanced chunking strategy. 
- Using `similarity_search_with_relevance_scores` function for retrieval.
- Adding the functionality of showing the retrieved context.

### ChatMyPDF - Version 1.2.0
This is the final version (up until now) that contains extra advanced modules for enhancing the performance:
- Implemented `query_optimization` module responsible for enhancing the query leveraging LLMs.
- Leveraging `re-ranking` module responsible for re-rank the documents after `retrieval` to better filter
out irrelevant context and ensure that only the relevant contexts is passed to the `generator` module.

## üìñ Usage

1. Open the app in your browser (default: `http://localhost:8501`).
2. Upload a PDF file.
3. Choose a model (`Cohere` or `Gemini`).
4. Decide to show the contexts and/or re-ranking results.
5. Ask questions about the document.
6. View AI-generated responses with retrieved context.
